For your final assignment I ask that you imagine a project beyond the classroom, with the potential for real-world significance. The project proposal genre includes documents like fellowship and grant applications, book and article pitches, and start-up business plans. For most students, the proposal will be related to the topic of their midterm bibliography. It should be no longer than **5 pages** and is due on **May 16th**. The proposal *must* be written in Markdown and submitted to the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/dhcolumbia/illicit-knowledge.git`. 

I suggest your proposal contain (at least) a concise treatment of the following along with any other sections you deem appropriate (in no particular order):

**Why?**  
What question are you asking and/or what problem are you trying to solve? Why should we care? What is your problematic? What philosophical, literary, social, ideological, technological, economic, or historical problems will your work engage? What audience are you trying to reach?

**What is it?**  
What exactly are you proposing? Be as specific as possible at this stage of your thinking (but don't fake it).

**Prior art**  
How do your questions fit into a broader intellectual tradition? Has something similar been tried before? Has it succeeded or failed and why? How is your idea different?

**How?**  
Where will you look for your answers? Create a sense of your archive / dataset. What kind of data or materials will you be looking for (literary, legal, civic, scientific)?  What are the biases implicit in your archive or dataset? What kind of things do you plan to include or exclude? What are your methods?  What kind of answers do you anticipate? What do you expect this material to tell you?  What form do you expect your thesis to take?  How might you structure your writing? What possible problems (theoretical, practical, or otherwise) could stand in the way of your analysis? What are your methods? Close reading?  Distant reading? Interviews? Archival research? Text analysis? Be practical and specific here.

**A plan of action**  
Identify any gaps you have. Will you need to recruit others for your project? How will you reach your audience? Describe work completed (if any). Come up with a reasonable timeline. Suggest per-week, per-month, per-semester goals and milestones. 

I will update this document following the class discussion.
