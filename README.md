date: Spring 2014
title: "ENGL 3915/6915 Digital Humanities Lab: Illicit Knowledge"
instructor: "Dennis Tenen"

**Where?** First meeting at Hamilton 607. Subsequent meetings at the Butler Studio.
**When?** Tuesdays 4-6pm + Lab 6:30-8pm

Every year the Digital Humanities Lab convenes to advance research in
computational culture studies understood both as the study of computational
culture and as computational approaches to the study of culture and society.
In addition to traditional reading, discussion, and writing components of the
class, participants are expected to work on a semester-long data-driven
lab-based research project. Students and scholars from any field, at any stage
of their academic or professional career, and at all levels of technical and
critical proficiency are welcome to attend.

The course was designed with two goals in mind: first, to expand our shared
methodological toolkit (aka, learn to code), and second, to examine the
critical literature on a selected topic related to texts, information
technology, and online communities. 

The theme for the spring of 2014 is illicit knowledge. In working with several
large datasets related to information piracy we will explore the ethics of
stealing and sharing, the history and the future of censorship, the
infrastructure and the social dynamics of underground library archives, laws
protecting and punishing whistleblowers, the difference between remix and
plagiarism, copyright regimes and free culture.

## What are the Digital Humanities?

Digital humanities are a diverse set of overlapping academic practices which
usually include some mixture of 1) computational and otherwise experimental
approaches to the study of the human condition; 2) modalities of cultural
preservation, content curation, and knowledge design; and finally, 3) social
advocacy and professional reform in response to developments in information
technology.

## Course Requirements and Grading

- 25% Class participation
- 25% Online participation
- 25% Midterm annotated biblio
- 25% Final project proposal

## Ethics Charter

Because our research may involve sensitive materials, we will spend some time
in class drafting an ethics charter. Last year's charter can be found here.
When working with others, it is important to give credit where credit is due.
When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your peers, your instructors,
and to the research community at large. It wastes my time and yours, and
ultimately is not worth the risk. Consult Columbia's guidelines or ask me for
help early in the writing process.
